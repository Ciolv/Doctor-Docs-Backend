# Doctor Docs Backend

Doctor Docs is an electronic health record service, created to reduce cost and accelerate information exchange.

By reducing double counting of diseases, doctor's offices can focus on what they really want to do, help people!
But not only do they have **more time to care about you**, they can do their work more cost-efficient. As they get paid
by
your health insurance, and you pay the health insurance, you can help **lowering your monthly contribution** by using
Doctor Docs!

Living on the countryside, struggling to find a doctor at all? Doctor Docs is here to help you!  
Many doctors can not make a living on the countryside, because of the way they get paid by health insurances.
And another time, the cost efficiency of Doctor Docs comes in handy. Doctor Docs will enable your Doctor to easily
access your hospital, or specialist documents, as you can share those documents with your doctor, as soon as you receive
them through doctor docs.  
Haven't got your documents through Doctor Docs? No problem, we got your back!  
Simply **upload** them yourself and **share** them with all the doctors you want.

Changing doctors has never been easier!  
Doctor Docs allows you to change your doctor by replacing all shares with your previous doctor with your new ony by one
click.

Documents are outdated?  
Easy one. Just delete them and no doctor will ever be confused by outdated documents anymore.
